# Implementation Plan B — Web backend (Laravel + MySQL)

Run the app on its own server: **Laravel** (PHP) API + **MySQL** database, serving the same pages we already built.
Compared with Plan A (Google Sheets), this is faster, stricter, easier to grow, and keeps all data and code under your control. It needs a small server and someone to look after it.

> Status: plan. No code yet. The front end (pages, design, gamification, shifts, photos) stays as it is.

---

## 1. Goals and limits

| | |
|---|---|
| **Goal** | Production web app for NIVEA SPG reporting, fast (< 300 ms per request), safe, ready to grow past 50 users |
| **Keeps** | All current pages and behaviour; the GitHub Pages demo keeps working in demo mode |
| **Changes** | `data.js` talks to the Laravel API; real login and sessions; real dates; data in MySQL |
| **Later (not in v1)** | Automatic WhatsApp messages via a provider, POS integration, native app |

---

## 2. Architecture

```
 SPG phone / Leader laptop                       Server (VPS or hosting with SSH)
┌──────────────────────────┐   HTTPS (same    ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│ Pages (HTML/CSS/JS)      │   domain)        │ Nginx → Laravel                   │
│  data.js → /api/...      │ ───────────────▶ │  /           static pages (public)│
│  session cookie          │ ◀─────────────── │  /api/*      JSON API (Sanctum)   │
│  offline sales queue     │                  │  queue + scheduler (cron)         │
└──────────────────────────┘                  │        │                          │
                                              │   MySQL 8      storage/ (photos)  │
                                              └──────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **One domain** (e.g. `laporan-spg.example.co.id`): Laravel serves the existing pages from `public/` and the API under `/api`. Same domain means we can use **secure session cookies** instead of tokens in the browser.
- **Laravel** (current release, PHP 8.3+), **MySQL 8** (or MariaDB 10.6+), **Laravel Sanctum** for login sessions.
- Timezone **Asia/Jakarta** everywhere (`config/app.php` and MySQL).

---

## 3. Database

Money is stored as whole Rupiah (`BIGINT UNSIGNED`). All tables have `created_at` / `updated_at`.

| Table | Columns | Indexes / notes |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| **users** | `id, phone (unique, 62…), name, role (enum spg/leader/supervisor/admin), area_id, team_id, store, photo_path, password, must_change_password, active, last_login_at` | `phone` unique; `team_id`, `area_id` |
| **areas** | `id, name, supervisor_id` | |
| **teams** | `id, name, area_id, leader_id` | `area_id` |
| **team_settings** | `team_id (PK), working_days (json, e.g. [1,2,3,4,5,6]), edit_days (default 2), reminder_time` | |
| **holidays** | `id, team_id (null = all teams), date, name, is_working_day` | unique `(team_id, date)` |
| **products** | `id, name, sku (unique, nullable), price, photo_path, active` | never deleted, only deactivated |
| **targets** | `id, user_id, month (char 7, '2026-10'), monthly, weekly (null), daily (null), set_by` | unique `(user_id, month)` |
| **shifts** | `id, user_id, date, started_at, ended_at (null)` | unique `(user_id, date)` |
| **sales** | `id, client_id (uuid, unique), user_id, date, sold_at (datetime), product_id, qty, price, subtotal, created_by, deleted_at (soft delete)` | `(user_id, date)`, `(date)`, `product_id`; `client_id` makes offline resend safe |
| **day_reports** | `id, user_id, date, no_sales, unlocked_by, unlocked_at` | unique `(user_id, date)`; only for the flags, totals come from `sales` |
| **sessions**, **personal_access_tokens**, **jobs**, **failed_jobs** | standard Laravel | database session driver, so sessions can be revoked per user |
| **activity_log** | `id, user_id, action, subject_type, subject_id, changes (json), ip` | audit of edits, unlocks, target changes, deactivations |

Volume check: 50 SPGs × ~15 sales/day ≈ 22k rows/month ≈ 270k/year. MySQL with the indexes above handles this easily; no archiving needed for years.

---

## 4. Business logic (server side)

Moved from today's `data.js` into Laravel services so every client sees the same numbers:

| Service | Responsibility |
|---------|---------------|
| `WorkingDayService` | is a date a working day for a team (weekdays + holidays) |
| `TargetService` | effective daily / weekly / monthly target (derived from monthly, overrides win) |
| `ProgressService` | actual vs target per SPG / team / area for day, week, month (SQL `SUM` grouped by user and date) |
| `LeaderboardService` | ranking by % of own target, ties by Rupiah; streaks; levels (Pemula → Berlian) |
| `SaleService` | add / remove sale, shift checks, edit-window and unlock rules, idempotency by `client_id` |
| `ReportExport` | CSV / Excel export per team and period (one row per sale) |

Dashboard responses are cached for 60 seconds per team and period, and cleared when a sale in that team changes.

---

## 5. API

All under `/api`, JSON, session cookie + CSRF (Sanctum SPA mode). Validation through Form Requests; permissions through Policies.

| Method & path | Who | Purpose |
|---------------|-----|---------|
| `POST /login`, `POST /logout` | all | phone + password, "ingat saya" 30 days |
| `GET /me`, `POST /me/password`, `POST /me/photo` | all | profile, change password, upload photo |
| `GET /bootstrap` | all | everything a page needs for the user's scope (same shape as today's data) |
| `POST /shifts/start`, `POST /shifts/end` | SPG | today's shift (server time) |
| `GET /sales?user=&team=&from=&to=` | owner / leader / supervisor | sales list (report details) |
| `POST /sales`, `DELETE /sales/{id}` | SPG (own), leader, supervisor | add / remove a sale |
| `POST /day-reports/{user}/{date}/unlock` / `lock` | leader, supervisor | open a locked day for the SPG |
| `GET /dashboard/team/{team}?period=` | leader, supervisor | summary, trend, ranking, products, missing shifts |
| `GET /dashboard/area/{area}?period=` | supervisor | team comparison, top SPGs |
| `GET/PUT /teams/{team}/targets?month=` | leader, supervisor | read / save targets |
| `GET/PUT /teams/{team}/settings`, `/holidays` | leader, supervisor | working days, edit window, holidays |
| `GET/POST/PATCH /users` (+ `/reset-password`, `/deactivate`) | leader (team SPGs), supervisor, admin | manage people |
| `GET/POST/PATCH /products`, `POST /products/{id}/photo`, `POST /products/import`, `GET /products/export` | admin | catalog, photos, Excel/CSV import & export |
| `GET /reports/export?team=&from=&to=` | leader, supervisor | Excel/CSV download |

---

## 6. Login, sessions and permissions

1. **Login with phone number + password.** Phone is normalised (`08…`, `+62…` → `62…`). Passwords hashed with Laravel's `Hash` (bcrypt/argon2).
2. **Sessions** are httpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax cookies stored in the `sessions` table; "Ingat saya" keeps them for 30 days. JavaScript never sees the session, so a script injected into the page can't steal it.
3. **CSRF** protection on every write (Sanctum SPA).
4. **Rate limit**: 5 failed logins per phone + IP per minute, then a short lockout (`RateLimiter`). Every login is written to `activity_log`.
5. **First login / reset**: users get a temporary password and must change it (`must_change_password`). A Leader can reset their SPGs; Admin can reset anyone.
6. **Deactivate / reset** deletes that user's rows in `sessions`, logging them out on every device immediately.
7. **Roles & scope** (Policies + a `role` middleware):
   - SPG: only own shifts and sales; today needs an open shift, past days only inside the team's edit window or when unlocked.
   - Team Leader: own team's SPGs, targets, settings, reports.
   - Supervisor: all teams in their area.
   - Admin: products, all users, all data.
8. Optional later: OTP via WhatsApp/SMS provider for login or password reset.

---

## 7. Photos

- Client already resizes photos (profile 192 px, product 320 px). Server re-encodes them (Intervention Image) to strip metadata and enforce size (max 1 MB, JPEG/PNG/WebP).
- Stored on the `public` disk (`storage/app/public/photos/...`), served as static files. Can move to S3-compatible storage (e.g. IDCloudHost Object Storage) by changing the disk config.
- Demo portraits and product illustrations stay as defaults until a real photo is uploaded.

---

## 8. Products: Excel instead of editing the Sheet

The Sheets plan lets Admin edit products in the spreadsheet. Here the equivalent is:
- **Export** the catalog to Excel, edit it, **import** it back (matched by SKU; new rows created, prices/active updated, nothing deleted). Uses `maatwebsite/excel`.
- Import shows a preview with errors per row before saving.
- Plus the existing in-app add/edit pop-up.

---

## 9. Front-end changes

Shared with the Sheets plan, so the work is done once:

1. `assets/js/config.js`: `BACKEND = 'demo' | 'sheets' | 'laravel'`. GitHub Pages stays `demo`.
2. `data.js` keeps its in-memory state; `await Data.ready()` loads `/api/bootstrap`. Read functions stay synchronous. Write functions become `async`, call the API, and roll back with a message on error.
3. Dashboards use `/api/dashboard/...` (server computes), so big areas stay fast.
4. Report details and exports call the API on demand.
5. Login page: phone + password, "Ingat saya", change-password screen; demo accounts hidden outside demo mode.
6. Offline queue for sales (same as Plan A), sent with `client_id`; loading states and error toasts.
7. Leader dashboard refreshes every 60 s while open (live enough; real-time push with Laravel Reverb is possible later).

---

## 10. Repository layout

The current static site stays at the repo root (GitHub Pages demo). The Laravel app lives next to it:

```
/                    → current pages (demo on GitHub Pages)
server/              → Laravel project
  app/Models, app/Http/Controllers/Api, app/Policies, app/Services
  database/migrations, database/seeders (DemoSeeder = today's demo data)
  routes/api.php
  tests/Feature      → API + permission tests per role
  deploy/sync-frontend.sh → copies the root pages into server/public on deploy
```

---

## 11. Hosting and operations

| Option | Cost (approx.) | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| **VPS in Indonesia** (e.g. IDCloudHost, Biznet Gio, DewaWeb) 2 vCPU / 2–4 GB | Rp 100–250k / month | **Recommended.** Data stays in Indonesia; full control |
| Shared hosting with SSH + PHP 8.3 (e.g. Niagahoster/Hostinger) | Rp 30–100k / month | Cheapest; queue/cron more limited |
| VPS + Laravel Forge or Ploi (server management service) | + ~US$10–15 / month | Easier deploys and updates if nobody wants to manage Linux |

Prices are rough; confirm with the provider at purchase time.

Operations:
- HTTPS with Let's Encrypt; domain or subdomain from the client.
- `cron` running `php artisan schedule:run` every minute:
  - 20:00 reminder list for Leaders (who hasn't started a shift / no sales) — shown in the app; WhatsApp sending later.
  - nightly database + photo backup (`spatie/laravel-backup`) to off-server storage, 30 days kept.
- Queue worker (Supervisor/systemd) for exports and image processing.
- Error tracking/log alerts (e.g. Laravel log to email or Sentry free tier).
- Deploys: `git pull` → `composer install --no-dev` → `php artisan migrate --force` → `sync-frontend.sh` → `php artisan optimize`, or via Forge/Ploi.

## 12. Phases

| Phase | Work | Result |
|-------|------|--------|
| **1. Foundation** | Laravel project, migrations, models, DemoSeeder, auth (phone login, sessions, rate limit, change password), roles & policies | Log in against MySQL |
| **2. Front-end adapter** | `config.js`, async `data.js` with `bootstrap`, loading/error states | Current pages run on the API |
| **3. SPG flow** | shifts, sales add/remove, edit window & unlock rules, idempotency, offline queue | Full shift on real data |
| **4. Dashboards & reports** | services, team/area dashboards, rankings, streaks, trend, exports | Leaders and Supervisor live |
| **5. Management** | users, targets, settings/holidays, products + Excel import/export, photos | Admin and Leaders self-sufficient |
| **6. Ops & hardening** | server setup, HTTPS, backups, scheduler, logs, activity log, load test | Ready for pilot |
| **7. Pilot** | 1 team for 1–2 weeks, fixes, then all teams | Go-live |

---

## 13. Testing

- **Feature tests** (PHPUnit/Pest) for every endpoint × role: allowed and forbidden cases, edit-window rules, idempotent sales, target derivation, holiday handling, rankings.
- **Existing Playwright tests** run against a local Laravel server seeded with `DemoSeeder` (same data as the demo, so expected numbers stay the same).
- **Load check**: 50 users posting sales at once, dashboard response times.
- **Manual pilot checklist**: two phones at once, airplane mode during a shift, deactivate while logged in, password reset, Excel import with mistakes.

## 14. Decisions

| # | Question | Decision |
|---|----------|----------|
| 1 | Backend | **Laravel + MySQL** |
| 2 | Login | **Phone number + password** |
| 3 | Photos | Stored on the server (`public` disk), can move to object storage |
| 4 | Product bulk edits | Excel export / import (replaces editing in the Sheet) |
| 5 | Hosting | **Open** (recommended: VPS in Indonesia) |
| 6 | Data must stay in Indonesia (UU PDP / NIVEA IT policy)? | **Open** |
| 7 | Who maintains the server after launch | **Open** |
| 8 | Offline sales queue from day one | **Open** (recommended: yes) |
| 9 | Domain / subdomain | **Open** |
| 10 | Do we still pilot on Google Sheets first, or go straight to Laravel? | **Open** |
