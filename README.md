# Laporan SPG — Laporan Penjualan Harian (NIVEA)

Prototype of a daily sales report app for SPGs, Team Leaders and Supervisors. Static HTML/CSS/JS with demo data; no server needed.

**Live demo:** https://muhghifari.github.io/sales-daily-report/

## Demo accounts

Log in with **phone number + password** (any format works: `0813 0000 0001`, `62813…`, `+62 813-…`). The eye button shows the password.

| Role | Phone | Password | Lands on |
|------|-------|----------|----------|
| SPG | `0813 0000 0001` (Sari) · `0813 0000 0002`–`0008` (other SPGs of Tim Jakarta Selatan) | `spg123` | Beranda |
| Team Leader | `0812 0000 0001` (Rina) | `leader123` | Dashboard Tim |
| Supervisor | `0811 0000 0002` (Budi) | `super123` | Dashboard Area |
| Admin | `0811 0000 0001` | `admin123` | Pengguna |

Try `0813 0000 0004` (Rani) to start a shift from scratch; Sari already has a shift running with sales.

"Today" in the demo is **Kamis, 22 Oktober 2026**. Changes (reports, targets, settings) are saved in your browser; use **Reset data demo** on the login page to start over.
The passwords are hardcoded in `assets/js/data.js` and visible to anyone — demo only.

See [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md) for the product plan, [`IMPLEMENTATION.md`](IMPLEMENTATION.md) for how the prototype is built, [`IMPLEMENTATION-GOOGLE-SHEETS.md`](IMPLEMENTATION-GOOGLE-SHEETS.md) for the plan to run it on Google Sheets, and [`IMPLEMENTATION-WEB.md`](IMPLEMENTATION-WEB.md) for the Laravel + MySQL web version.

## Publishing changes

After editing any page, run `python3 tools/bump-version.py` before committing. It stamps a new version on every page and in `assets/version.json`; pages that a browser still has cached detect the newer version and reload themselves, so nobody sees a mix of old and new pages.

## Photos

- **Profile photos**: SPGs tap their photo on Beranda to take or choose a new one; Team Leaders can set an SPG's photo in Kelola Tim. Demo users start with illustrated portraits in `assets/avatars/` (DiceBear "Lorelei" by Lisa Wischofsky, CC0 1.0, generated with `tools/generate-avatars.js`).
- **Product photos**: Admin can upload a photo per product. Demo products start with simple illustrations in `assets/products/` — replace them with the official packshots from the client.
- Uploaded photos are resized in the browser and stored with the demo data.
- **Logo**: see `assets/brand/README.md`.
